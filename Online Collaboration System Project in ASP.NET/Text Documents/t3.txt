<P>As an online student you may be asked to participate in group discussions and assignments. Working in an online virtual team is a new experience for many. </P>

<P><B>Why work in teams?</B></P>
<P>Teamwork allows you to share information and ideas. It also helps you to develop some of the skills that employers are looking for – managing a project, negotiation, working as a team member. </P>
<P><B>How virtual teamwork works</B></P>
<P>Studying online does not mean that you are studying on your own. Blackboard offers various ways of collaborating online. Here are just some of them:</P></TD>
<TD vAlign=top align=right width="10%"><IMG height=247 alt="I liked the interaction with the other team members.  Everybody was from different backgrounds, which opened up the debate and really challenged my views on the topic." src="/images/ole71.jpg" width=230></TD></TR>

<LI>The <B>Discussion Board</B> allows you to post and respond to messages. If you post a message, it will be seen by all the other students and your facilitator when they next access the discussion board from their computer. The messages on the Discussion board stay visible for the duration of the unit and everyone has a chance to respond to any of the messages. <BR><BR>
<LI>Through online <B>chat</B> you can ‘talk’ to others in real time. As you type in your message, anybody else who is logged in to the Chat session at the same time can read and respond directly to your message. <BR><BR>
<LI>If required by your unit, the members of a team can all work on the same file thanks to the <B>file sharing</B> function in Blackboard. This way, if you make a change to a document, the others can see your change as soon as they log in to Blackboard and open the document. </LI></UL></TD>

<LI><B>Stay in touch</B> with one another. Check the Discussion board and post a short message at least twice a week—it doesn’t have to be relevant or very long, but it will show that you are interested and contributing to the team. <A class=info href="#"><IMG height=22 alt=Tip src="/images/ole07_tip.gif" width=44 align=absMiddle border=0><SPAN>If you don't hear from a team member for a while, try contacting them by e-mail or by phone (if you have the other team members' phone numbers).</SPAN></A><BR><BR>
<LI>Handle <B>differences of opinion</B> at the group level. Discussions should be over the concept in question, not aimed at the individual. <A class=info href="#"><IMG height=22 alt=Tip src="/images/ole07_tip.gif" width=44 align=absMiddle border=0><SPAN>Say what you like about an idea before criticising.
